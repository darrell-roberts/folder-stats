# folder stats
A simple `du` like command. Sums the total folder sizes recursively and shows
first level total sizes, distribution and file counts.

Ex:
```
$ f-stats
        Size   dist.      Files Folder Name
      1.4 KB   0.00%          1 ./src
     42.1 KB   0.05%         76 ./.git
     78.0 MB  99.94%        714 ./target
     78.0 MB 100.00%        795 .
```
